        Ever wrapped a prep shift, looked down at a trashcan full to the brim
        with the carcasses of pressed citrus, and
        <s>pondered your own mortality</s> wondered if there's a more
        sustainable way to run a bar? If so, you're not alone, and the good news
        is there's a better way! Thanks to modern science and bartender/genuine

      <p>
        With a little help from powdered citric and malic acids, we can slow
        down the usual oxidation that instantly starts degrading fresh juice on
        its own. The process starts by peeling your citrus with as little white
        pith as possible, weighing the peels, and putting them in a jar (big
        enough to accommodate a stick blender if you've got one) with the
        appropriate amount of citric (and malic for lime and orange) acid. Then,
        shake the jar and let it rest for up to 2 hours. This creates "oleo
        citrate", which is like the acidified sibling of the "oleo saccharum"
        created when macerating fruit with sugar.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, pour everything from the jar into a blender and add water (see
        table for specs), being sure to rinse the jar with your measured water
        to get all of that good oleo citrate out. Or just add water to your jar
        if using a stick blender. Then, juice your citrus and add it to the mix.
        Blend for ~30 seconds, strain through a milk bag or cheesecloth and
        boom, you've got Super Juice. It's darned close to shelf stable and will
        taste like freshly squeezed juice for 2 weeks!
